# Image Combinator

There are times when we get to capture different pictures/scence from videos. 
As the number of captured files become larger, it becomes hassle to reorganize and upload them in a right order.
This program helps you to add multiple image files and combine them with different options; including the file format selection, resize image, 
and add spacing between combined images for better display.

###### Widths

###### Spacing

###### Format

###### Screenshot
